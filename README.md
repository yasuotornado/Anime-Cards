# Anime-Cards
This is the ultimate Dueling Nexus anime card style pack and it's too large to add to userstyles so it will have to be downloaded from here.

Please use STYLUS for this project instead of STYLIISH
Stylus seems to work better for some reason and I'll try to find out why at a later time.

Stylus for Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en
Stylus for FireFox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/
